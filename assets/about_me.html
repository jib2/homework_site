		<p id="below">I am a born and raised North Carolinian constantly looking for something new to try. I love the outdoors from snow to sunshine. I binged on skiing when I was younger, and have recently indulged in mountain climbing. I love canoeing, but am absolutely terrified of the ocean. When I was four, I ran in the opposite direction of the tide yelling, "the tide is going to get me!" Not much has changed. Scotland has been a great place for these interests. Seeing as I am around beautiful areas a lot, I have taken up photography. Those skills are definitely still a work in progress. I love cooking in small doses, know how to play the drums, and I am always up for a game of billiards as well.
		<br></br>This blog shares some of my travel, food, photography, and other adventures.</p>
